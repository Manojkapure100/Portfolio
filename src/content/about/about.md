My journey began at VNSGU Surat, where I earned my post-graduation degree. Shortly after, I secured an on-campus placement, which led to an exciting opportunity with BBD for a six-month internship. Based on my performance during the internship, I was fortunate to receive a full-time position. This experience allowed me to gain hands-on knowledge of how things work in the real world, bridging the gap between theory and practice.

Like many developers, I’ve also gone through the rigorous LeetCode journey, sharpening my problem-solving skills along the way. In addition to my work, I actively contribute to open-source projects and am always looking for new ways to give back to the tech community.

When I'm not coding, you’ll find me on the badminton court, playing cricket, or unwinding with a good TV series.
