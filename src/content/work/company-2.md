During my internship at BBD India, I had the opportunity to work on intenship project. it was a **Real Estate Project Management Tool**, designed for builders, contractors, and developers. The tool enabled efficient task and resource management, similar to Trello (by Atlassian), streamlining project workflows.

I also led a presentation on **CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins**, providing the team with insights on automating and optimizing our deployment processes.

Additionally, I contributed to a live client project, where I focused on resolving frontend bugs, ensuring a seamless user experience and improving overall project quality.
