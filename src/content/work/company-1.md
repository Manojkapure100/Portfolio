During my time as a Junior Software Engineer at BBD India, I worked as a full-stack developer on several high-impact projects, contributing to both internal and client websites.

I played a key role in enhancing the company’s internal website **The Hive**, which included developing a platform to train new employees, and creating courses for upskilling. I also contributed to the **annual review system**, improving its functionality and performance.

One of my major achievements was building a **profile feature** that displays employee details, including their photos, departments, experiences, and skills, streamlining internal collaboration and communication.

Later, I transitioned to working on **SARS**, where I resolved several **production-critical bugs**, ensuring smooth operations for the company. I then moved to **DSTI**, where I optimized database queries, added new features, and enhanced API performance to improve both user and developer experiences.

Currently, I am working on **both** SARS and DSTI, handling multiple projects simultaneously, resolving bugs, optimizing performance, and developing new features.
