During my time as a Junior Software Engineer at BBD India, I worked as a full-stack developer on several high-impact projects, contributing to both internal and client websites.

I played a key role in enhancing the company’s internal learning platform, which included developing a training system for new employees and creating upskilling courses. I also contributed to the annual review system, improving its functionality and performance.

One of my major achievements was building a profile feature that displays employee details, including photos, departments, experience, and skills, streamlining internal collaboration and communication.

Later, I transitioned to work on a client-facing system where I resolved production-critical bugs to ensure smooth operations. I then moved to a data-focused project, where I optimized database queries, added new features, and enhanced API performance to improve both user and developer experiences.

Currently, I work across multiple active projects, handling bugs, optimizing performance, and developing new features.
